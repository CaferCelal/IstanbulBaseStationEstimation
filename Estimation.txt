I know that hexagon style used in base stations built. In hexagon style, regular hexagons used to cover
an area. Each hexagon uses same edges with its neighbour hexagons and base stations builds in their center.
Now, you want me to estimate how many base stations in Istanbul. I'm going to try to guess numbers of base
stations for mobile phones in Istanbul, I'll ignore base stations that uses different types of frequency such
as radio base stations or base stations for using only military reasons. I dont have any known data for cover
areas of base stations. But I found this paragraph in Wikipedia.
/*
In cities, each cell site may have a range of up to approximately 1‚ÅÑ2 mile (0.80 km), while in rural areas,
the range could be as much as 5 miles (8.0 km). It is possible that in clear open areas, a user may receive
signals from a cell site 25 miles (40 km) away. In rural areas with low-band coverage and tall towers,
basic voice and messaging service may reach 50 miles (80 km), with limitations on bandwidth and number of
simultaneous calls.
Here is the source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network#Cellular_frequency_choice_in_mobile_phone_networks

According to this paragraph I'll accept the range as 40 km. It's kinda hard to place hexagons on map, so I
have an easier choice. There is a website calls "Nukemap". It calculates areas that effected of the bombs.
I'll use this website and imagine bombs as base stations. I used 22800 kilotons of warhead, which and that
provided me 40km thermal radiation radius, which is the distance that I needed as you can find in Images
directory, Range image. After that, I covered all Istanbul with 3 base stations. So my estimation/calculation
is 3.
I'd like to remind that it's just a basic estimation. In real life the other factors matters, like geographical
area, population of city...
